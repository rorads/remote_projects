# Remote Projects Box

This repository is used to house a set of projects which can be pulled to a compute instance and developed remotely.

## Principles

* **Desposable**: although there will be some setup required for a given compute box, it should ultimately be desposable. Persistance and storage shouldn't be assumed.
* **Platform independent**: GCP, AWS, Azure - doesn't matter.
* **Data lives elsewhere**: Buckets, local, open, etc.
* **Living documentation**: it can be scrappy, but it should be there.
* **Mostly Vanilla**:
  - Python3
  - pip3
  - git
  - Jupyter
  - VS Code
  - id_rsa authentication
